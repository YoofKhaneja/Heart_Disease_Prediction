# Predicting CHD (Coronary Heart Disease)

This repository contains various models and implementations to predict the occurrence of CHD based on data from the following data set:

## Work done so far:


### Data exploration and Logistic Regression
The data was analysed, missing values were imputed and logistic regression was performed by tweaking various parameters and by applying various techniques like SMOTE.

### Simple Neural Network
A vanilla feed-forward neural network was built and trained to get the best possible results.

### Siamese Network for Discriminative Learning
A Siamese model was used to differentiate between poitive and negative samples.

### Generating Embeddings from the Siamese Network
The weights of the Siamese network were used to generate new, better embeddings for easier classification.
